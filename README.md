### Neural Networks & Stuff

Ive been into neural networks for quite a few years already, quite possibly a drug addiction. Nonetheless, this book is dedicated to whatever I have been exploring. Obviously, there are bits and pieces that I have not added (or am quite possibly too lazy to share)... But I guess it has various notebooks that may come off as useful to those who want to start of in neural networks? (Like your basic MLP).

Anyways, I will try my best to be updating it monthly (and hope I will not forget about it). Any resources you guys would like to share would be greatly appreciated :).

p.s. Obviously, there are some stuff that I cant push like the weights (which you can conveniently find on huggingface or on some random Google drive link).
